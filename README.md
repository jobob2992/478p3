=====
This is a project from Logic Circuit Synthesis and Optimization
In it, we were provided a framework defined by circuit, node, and truthtable.
Given that, we had to design methods for the program such that it could take an arbitrary BLIF file as input
and perform a topological sort on it or evaluate it for some set of inputs.
My methodology is described in report_joesteve.pdf
